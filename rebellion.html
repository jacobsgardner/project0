                <p>Chewie's path towards joining the rebellion began on the planet Tatooine, where he was hiding out with his partner,
                    Han Solo, from the intergalactic ganster Jabba the Hutt, of the Hutt crime family. Han and Chewbacca were hired to transport
                    the young Luke Skywalker and the ageing Obi-Wan (Old Ben) Kenobi to the planet Alderan. Upon discovering that Alderan was
                    destroyed the passengers of the Milenium Falcon were captured by the Death Star, a small moon sized imperial ship and weapon.
                    On the Death Star Chewie, posing as a hardened criminal, took part in the daring rescue of Princess Leaia Organa. Once the
                    princess was returned to the Rebel Alliance Chewie and Han decided to take their reward and and leave to repay their debt
                    to Jabba. But after having second thoughts they returned and helped helped the Rebel Alliance destroy the Death Star.</p>

                    the Milenium Falcon allowing him and Han to escape from the clutches of the invading Imperial forces. While hiding out
                    in Cloud City Chewbacca, along with his friends, were betrayed by Lando Calrisian. They then had to escape th imperial

                <p>Chewbacca then took part in the rescue of his best friend Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt. Once Solo was once again safe,
                him and Chewie teamed up for the incredibly important mission of destroying the shield generator for the Death Star.
                Teaming up with the Ewoks of Endor he, along with his team were able to defeat the imperial forces guarding the shield
                generators. This allowed the Rebel Alliance to once again destroy the Death Star, and this time defeat the Galactic Empire.</p>
