            Chewie's path towards joining the rebellion began on the planet Tatooine where he was hiding out with his partner
            Han Solo from the intergalactic ganster Jabba the Hut, of the Hut crime family. Han and Chewbacca were hired to transport
            the young Luke Skywalker and the ageing Obi-Wan (Old Ben) Kenobi to the planet Alderan. Upon discovering that Alderan was
            destroyed the passengers of the Milenium Falcon were captured by the Death Star, a small moon sized imperial ship and weapon.
            On the Death Star Chewie, posing as a hardend criminal, took part in the daring rescue of Princess Leaia Organa. Once the
            princess was returned to the Rebel Alliance Chewie and Han decided to take their reward and and leave to repay their debt
            to Jabba. But after having second thoughts they returned and helped helped the Rebellion destroy the Death Star.
