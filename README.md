# Project 0

For this project I created a website about Chewbacca. The site contains 4 pages, a homepage, a page about Chewie's involment in the
Rebel Alliance, his bowcaster, and his friendship with Han Solo. The main files in this project are a scss file with style information
for the webpage, css file with the sass converted results of this file, a few picture files used on the the pages and the html files
for the pages.
